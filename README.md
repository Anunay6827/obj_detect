# Object Detection using Arduino and ESP32

Building Object Detection Systems
Object detection systems use a "model" to identify objects in live videos. To create such a system, follow these steps:

Gather Data

Collect numerous images of the object from various angles, distances, and lighting conditions.
Label each image by tracing the object with a bounding box.
This step is time-consuming but crucial for system accuracy.


Build a Model

Use a neural network to process the organized data and create the detection model.
Neural networks consist of layers of nodes (neurons) that simulate the brain’s logic gates.
They learn from data, adapting connections and weights for pattern recognition.
Building models often requires significant computing power, typically leveraging GPUs for parallel processing.
Cloud-based services can be used for model building.


Deploy the Model

After training, deploy the model to the target system, which should have appropriate video capabilities.
If inaccuracies are found, retrain the model with more images or adjusted neural network parameters.
By following these steps, you can construct and deploy an effective object detection system.



You could either use a python program to build a model, or use Edge Impulse to create a model for you.


Here are the steps to use Edge Impulse in detail:

Collect Images – You’ll need to take pictures of your target object from different angles and views. For accurate object detection, you might need 50 or more images for each object.
Label Images – This is the process of drawing bounding boxes around the objects and labeling them. It is a bit time-consuming, but it is an essential step. 

Train Model – Now that you have your images labeled, you can train a model using them. You’ll be setting up a neural network and running your data through it.

Export Model – Once you have your model properly trained, you can export it to a format that is compatible with the ESP32-CAM board.

Run Model – Run your model on the ESP32-CAM board and see if it works! You can always redo some of the training if the results are not what you had hoped for.


Processing with Edge Impulse:

Label Images:

Go to the Data Acquisition screen.
Click on the "Labelling Queue" link to label images.
Draw a bounding box around the object in each image and assign a label.
Click "Save labels" and repeat for all images.

Create Impulse:

Go to the "Impulse Design" section and click "Create Impulse."
Verify image settings (96px width and height, resize mode using the shortest axis).
Add Processing Block: Select "Image" and save.
Add Learning Block: Select "Object Detection (Images)" and save.

Save Impulse.

Image Processing:

Set Color Depth to Grayscale and save.
Click "Generate Features" to analyze and extract image features.
Verify distinct clusters in the Feature Explorer.
Object Detection
Choose "FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) MobileNetV2 0.1" as the model.
Click "Start Training" to build the model.
Review the "Confusion Matrix" for model accuracy.
Export to Arduino Library
Go to the "Deployment" menu and select "Arduino Library."
Click "Build" to download the ZIP file.

Loading to ESP32-CAM:

Keep track of the downloaded ZIP file for use with the Arduino IDE.
